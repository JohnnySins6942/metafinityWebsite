            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Metafinity® is a futuristic concept for a metaverse, a space between virtual and physical reality in which real-world real world applications can be realized in a virtual environment. These environments represented by NFTS can be owned, bought, sold, and in the near future deeply customized.
                <br><br>
                Metafinity® will be a digital and virtual world which will then set a stage on which a much wider set of activities besides world-building can take place. We are undertaking this massive project in five stages.                          
                                <br></p>
            <br>
            <h3>Stage 1</h3>
            <br>
            <p>In Phase 1 (Stage 1), we will launch our Website, introducing our social media sites and begin development of our metaverse system</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Stage 2</h3>
            <Br>
            <p>In Phase 2 (Stage 2), we will launch our NFT Collection of 25,000 tiles of land and our pre-metaverse system where users can interact with their land and other people's lands. </p>
            <br><h3>Stage 3</h3>
            <br>
            <p>In Phase 3 (Stage 3), we will be launching the beta version of Metafinity®. Users will be able to gather and transfer resources to other users, and begin terraforming and building on their lands. We will also be introducing a ranking system for land to determine how valuable each tile is. Not only so, but we will also be beginning development of a native cryptocurrency system that can be used to settle transactions within Metafinity® </p>
            <br><h3>Stage 4</h3>
            <br>
            <p>In Phase 4 (Stage 4), we will be our native cryptocurrency system, and begin developing an NFT system for characters/avatars. We will also begin development of our in game NFT item system with our own native NFT marketplace for said items. We will be introducing another collection of 25,000 tiles of land during this period, as well as begin development on an alternate reality mobile app for your land.  </p>
           <br> <h3>Stage 5</h3>
            <br>
            <p>In Phase 5 (Stage 5), we will be fully releasing Metafinity®, which will include the transfer from PC applications to Virtual reality applications. We will also be fully releasing our mobile alternate reality app. </p>

            <h2>Part B - Buying and Selling Virtual Land in Metafinity</h2>
            <br>
            <p>A key aspect of the Metafinity® platform will be the ability for registered users to buy and sell land tiles (NFTS).
<br><Br>                
                Each tile of Virtual Land/NFTs will be a virtual equivalent to a real-world measurement of approximately 256mX256m, although they may not all be of exactly identical size. The size and positioning of the Virtual Land is established and controlled by us in our sole discretion.
                <Br><br>
                The first-sale of each tile of Virtual Land/NFTs will be based on a value that we assign to it in ETH. Future sales between registered users will be struck at a price agreed between those users.
                <Br><br>                                                             
                If the registered user who holds the rights in any Virtual Land/NFTs (Seller) wishes to sell that Virtual Land/NFTs, it can place the land/NFTs for sale on the designated NFT marketplace. Other users can bid on that Virtual Land/NFT, and the successful buyer (as determined by the Seller) will become eligible to take ownership of the Virtual Land/NFT (Buyer), subject to paying the agreed price to the Seller for the relevant Virtual Land/NFT, and payment to us of the relevant transaction fee (2.5%) (Transaction Fee).
                <Br><br>
                Without limiting any aspect of Part B of these terms, you must not acquire Virtual Land/NFTs for the purpose of inciting religious or racial tensions, or engage in any conduct or behavior in connection with Virtual Land/NFTs that is designed or is likely to incite religious or racial tensions. In addition to other rights we may have under these terms and under applicable law (including the right to cancel your membership without compensation).
                 <Br><br>               
                We will settle any disputes in relation to any ownership of Virtual Land according to the process that we maintain for that purpose from time to time.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Liability</h3>
            <br>
            <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, and subject to the rest of this section ‘Liability’, we are not liable for any loss or damage (including without limitation any Consequential Loss), however caused (including by negligence), suffered in connection with Virtual Land and NFTs (including sales, purported sales, failed transactions, disputes, transactions not recorded on the block chain or any forfeited Virtual Land).
<br><Br>
                Consequential Loss means: loss of revenues; loss of reputation; loss of profits; consequential loss; loss of actual or anticipated savings; loss of bargain; indirect loss; lost opportunities (including opportunities to enter into arrangements with third parties); and loss or damage in connection with claims against you by third parties.
                <br><Br>      
                If the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) or any other legislation states that there is a guarantee in respect of goods or services supplied, and our liability for breach of that guarantee may not be excluded but may be limited, our liability for such breach is limited to, in the case of a supply of goods, replacing the goods or supplying equivalent goods or repairing the goods, or in the case of supply of services, supplying the services again or paying the cost of having the services supplied again.</p>
